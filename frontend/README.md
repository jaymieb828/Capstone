# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ReactDjango_JWT_StarterCode

Starter code for full stack React + Django applications using JWT for authentication/authorization and a fully working register/login system on the React side

## NOTE

"cars" app in Django backend for example purposes only. Study it closely and review provided resources to understand how to properly create protected endpoints that require a JWT token for authorization.

## For implementing user roles

- see comments in the following files in the order they are listed
  - backend/authentication/models.py
  - backend/authentication/serializers.py (note that there are several places needing modification in that file)
- If modifying the User class in authentication/models.py, make sure to drop your existing database,
  create it, and run migrations from scratch
- for a great reference, see the following article: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/01/18/how-to-implement-multiple-user-types-with-django.html
  - note that this article is from 2018 and dealing with a full stack Django application scenario with HTML/CSS templates. The principles of setting up the backend portion for User roles is still valid!
- once user roles are set up on your backend, you can now utilize them on the frontend. Recommend reviewing the React Router slideshow for ideas on how to use descendant routes and conditional rendering to control who can access what parts of your application based on a role!
